# Psbt Network

Psbt Network is an open protocol for Bitcoin that enables trustless collaboration between multiple parties to create, sign, validate, finalize, and broadcast transactions.

It provides a modular framework where developers can build Bitcoin applications without needing to reinvent solutions for each new use case.

## What is Psbt Network?

Psbt Network manages the various stages of Bitcoin transaction creation and broadcasting, allowing multiple participants to safely cooperate without sharing private keys or complex authorization to use funds.

By using Psbt Network, developers can implement financial instruments such as swaps, lending, borrowing, and staking while maintaining a secure and scalable environment.

The protocol is designed to minimize on-chain transactions, reduce costs, and avoid overengineering.

## Why Contribute?

This is an open and standardized protocol for the Bitcoin ecosystem, and your contributions are vital to its success. Psbt Network is designed to be flexible and extendable. You can contribute by:

- Develop protocol implementation.
- Implementing new modules for different instruments.
- Proposing improvements to the protocol through new Psbt Network Improvement Proposals (PNIP).
- Optimizing existing modules to enhance performance and security.
- Building tools, libraries, or apps that integrate Psbt Network.

## How to Contribute

1. **Explore the Codebase**: Review the core Psbt Network protocol and existing modules.
2. **Propose a New PNIP**: If you have a new idea or enhancement, submit a Psbt Network Improvement Proposal (PNIP).
3. **Open Issues or Submit PRs**: Identify bugs or areas of improvement and submit pull requests to fix them.

## Get Involved

- **Discussions**: Discuss new features, ideas, and improvements.
- **Development**: Help build out the protocol by contributing code or new ideas.
- **Documentation**: Improve existing documentation or write new guides to help others get started.
